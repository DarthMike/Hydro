/*
	MODIFICATIONS FROM ORIGINAL: ALL MODIFS ARE MARKED WITH: //MIGUEL MODIFICATION
		- IND_RENDER METHOD: BlitTriangleList Added
		- IND_RENDER: Method SetForPrimitive was not adding IND_ALPHA to make transparencies when blitting!
		- IND_Entity2d: Method GetLayer() added, added int variable mLayer (to get layer of entity easily)
						Method SetLayer(int newlayer) added
		- IND_Entity2d: Method Add(int layer, IND_Entity2d* entity) changed to make a setlayer of the entity
		- IND_Entity2d: Method SetSequence (int pSequence) didnt restart previous animation when setting a new one
										                   this caused me a lot of problems having 1 replay more when 
														   changing animations and replaying no times (pReplays 1)
														   Also needed to put "Active" flag right on to 1, as from there, it 
														   must be considered that animation is active (coherence of flags)
		- IND_Entity2d: Method SetNumReplays(int pReplays  Had to change it as now, to replay, you put how many times 
															you want to replay. If parameter is 0, no replays are made
		- IND_RenderText2d: Method BlitText() Changed it to be able to scale the related entity and make the text bigger as it 
											  should be. Before scale didnt affect to text
