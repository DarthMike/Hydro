/*!
This class stores 2d surfaces (IND_Surface) that can be inserted into a IND_Entity2d and rendered to 
the screen using IND_Entity2dManager::RenderEntities2d().

IND_Surface is the most used object
in the library due to its versatility. Suppose that we use \b IndieLib to develop a game.
The IND_Surface object will be the sprite of the main character or enemies, the background scroll, 
the tiles of the map, the markups of life, etc.

All graphic entities in \b IndieLib that are drawn in the screen as a surface, including 
text and animations, are internally managed by IND_Surface class.

One of the main characteristics of a IND_Surface is that it can have any desired size
(it doesn't matter the maximum texture of the graphic card and they don't need to be power of two). 
And you can use a big IND_Surface as s a  \b scroll, without worrying about the areas that are out of 
the screen (because blocks outside the viewport will be automatically discarded). Furthermore, 
to make scroll creation easier, <b>the size of blocks</b>, in which the surface is
divided when it is created from a ::IND_Image object or directly from a graphic file <b>can be 
specified</b>.

There are several types of surfaces (see ::IND_Type), each type is used for a different purpose:
- IND_ALPHA: Per pixel transparency using alpha channel
- IND_OPAQUE: Opaque

To <b>save memory</b> or to get <b>black and white images</b>, it is also possible to specify
differents surfaces qualities (see ::IND_Quality).
