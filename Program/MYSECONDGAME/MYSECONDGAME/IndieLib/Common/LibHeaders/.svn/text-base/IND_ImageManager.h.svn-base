Manager of IND_Image objects. Click in ::IND_ImageManager to see all the methods of this class.

/*@{*/

/*!
This manager that stores IND_Image objects works as a mediator between the image (bitmap) loaded
in memory and the IND_Surface object which finally appears in the screen. The IND_Image objects 
which are stored in this class can not be rendered directly to the screen.
But this class is very useful for applying <b>filters</b> (like in Gimp or Photoshop programs) to 
loaded images, and later they can be converted to IND_Surface objects, which can be directly 
rendered.

Other possible uses of this class are: 
- <b>Hardness maps</b>. Used for making collisions or path finding.
- GetPixel() / PutPixel() 
- <b>Colorkey</b>. By changing a certain color into transparent using SetAlpha().
- Generation of new images (procedurally).
- Convert formats. Changing the number of bytes per pixel using Convert() 
- Direct accesing to the bitmap. Using IND_Image::GetPointer()
