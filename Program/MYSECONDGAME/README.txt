Hydro, is a physics-based platformer game. In this game you control a magical being, 
which ends trapped in a drop of water... that is, some kind of amorphous blob! 
Your objective is to collect other "fellow" water drops scattered throughout the levels. 
As a drop of water, you are very delicate, and you have to be careful not to be damaged by falling 
or splattered by heavy objects.

The abilities of the blob are:

- Move (of course!)

- Shoot smaller blobs, controlling them, to reach far places.

- Absorb and collect other blobs (thrown) and fellow drops.

- Move objects by pushing

- Make objects wet when "sacrificing". If you blow (intentionally or by accident) a small blob near some object, 
  it will get wet, effectively affecting the friction of it. (You can push heavier objects, or make some objects fall...)
  
- (more to come - WIP)

**********CONTROLS**********:

- Arrow Keys: Move the blob - You can push objects to move them Not too strong or you will damage yourself!

- Right-Mouse button (hold and release): Throw a smaller blob, to reach far places. You loose some health when throwing, so dont do it just because!. Be careful not to do it too strong or you will destroy it at impact!

-(When controlling small blob): CTRL will get control back to big blob, leaving the other where it is.
	NOTE: YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO GO BACK TO THE THROWN BLOB! 

-(When controlling small blob): SHIFT will sacrifice the blob (it will die) to make any TOUCHING object around WET. This 
  makes lower the object friction.
  
-(When controlling big blob): Approach fellow drops of water to collect them.

-(When controlling big blob): Approach thrown blobs to absorb them and gain your health again.

- SPACE: Free camera mode to observe the level.

- MOUSE-WHEEL: Zoom In and Out

NOTE YOU CAN'T JUMP! You can climb, nevertheless, when controlling a small blob.


******THIS GAME IS Work-in-progress: I would like feedback!!! *******

- For now, only first level (kind of tutorial) is included...

- No music and SFX yet...

- More levels and abilities to come!

- Game menus and better tutorial through some levels too...
