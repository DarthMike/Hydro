# Hydro

## Overview

**Hydro** is a game prototype I made. Consists of a puzzle platformer where you control a drop of water in a journey to collect other scattered drops through a house (starting from the roof after a rain). 

For now, it consists only of a 2-level demo, and development stopped. I pretend to go on with other projects and leave the game as it is now. 

##Platforms

* Windows

## Features
* Physics platformer prototype
* A symulation of a drop of water with rigid body physics
* Integration with Box2D
* Integration with Indielib
* Integration with OpenAL
* Ogg files playback

## Playing it
- "Arrow Keys": Move the blob - You can push objects to move them Not too strong or you will damage yourself!

- "Right-Mouse button" (hold and release): Throw a smaller blob, to reach far places. You loose some health when throwing, so dont do it just because!. Be careful not to do it too strong or you will destroy it at impact!

- "CTRL": If you control a small blob, you will get control back to big blob, leaving the other where it is.
- "SHIFT": Sacrifice small blob (it will die) to make any TOUCHING object around WET. This makes lower the object friction.
